			Of course humans are the primary reason the Human Fund is able to help humanity.  With generous monetary contributions,
			humans help the Human Fund help other humans.  It's a beautiful cycle.  Giving to the Human Fund is not just 'the right
			thing to do', it also makes you feel better about yourself and can come in handy around tax time.  Find out how to

			Humans who help humans deserve to be paid back some how so we help our donors make the most out of their
			donations to the Human Fund.  We employ a massive team of accountants and attorneys to ensure your donations
			stay away from the prying eyes of the federal government and anyone else for that matter.  The Human Fund wants you
			to know your <strike>laundered money</strike> donation is safe.
